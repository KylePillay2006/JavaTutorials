## 📌 Overview
Welcome to my **Java Projects Portfolio** — a growing collection of Java programs designed to build a strong foundation in **core Java programming** and **problem-solving**.

This repository documents my learning journey through structured, hands-on projects that focus on logic, clean code, and real-world applications. Each project reinforces key Java concepts and prepares me for more advanced backend and software development work.
